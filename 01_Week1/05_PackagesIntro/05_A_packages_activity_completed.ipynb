    "In Python, there is often something that you want to be able to do that someone else has already figured out. For example, you may want to read an excel file, or plot some data, or calculate some statistic. You don't need to start from scratch and write an entire script that accomplishes tasks like this. Instead you can do what's called an ``import``, which basically gives you access to code that someone else has written. To do this, you just need to know the name of the ``package``, and the name of the ``function`` you want to use. In this activity, you'll use what you learned about reading documentation to implement code written by someone else, that you can use for your own purposes. "
